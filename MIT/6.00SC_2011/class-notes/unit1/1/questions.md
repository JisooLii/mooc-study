### Problems
1. What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?
2. What is the advantage of a stored-program computer?
3. What are the syntax, static semantics, and semantics of a language?
4. What sorts of errors can occur in a program?


### Answers
1. Declarative knowledge is statements of fact; imperative knowledge is "how to" knowledge.
2. It's far more versatile than a fixed-program computer, since it interprets a program given to it and carries out those instructions, as opposed to being built to do one thing.
3. Syntax determines whether a string is legal, static semantics determine whether the string has meaning, and semantics assigns a meaning to a legal sentence (assuming no static semantic errors).
4. It can crash, run forever, or give a wrong answer.

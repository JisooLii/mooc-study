1. What is a 'type'?

    - Everything in a language, everything in a program is an object. A type of object is what form the object is. 
It can be integer, float number, string, or boolean as true or false value, for example.
 
    - Answer: Types are classifications of objects, which is what Python, as an OOP language, deals with. They determine how those objects are dealt with (for example, adding two integers results in an integer, two strings results in a concatenated string, and an integer and a string results in an error).

2. What is an 'expression'?

    - It is what constitutes a program. A program is a sequence of expression, 
and each expression is made up with operators, operands and functions.

    - Answer: An expression is composed of objects (or operands) and operators, and can be interpreted into a value.
 
3. What is a type conversion?
    - A type conversion means to change the type of an object. For example, 2 is an interger, but '2' is a string.
    - Answer: A type conversion turns one type of object into another. For example, applying str to the integer 3 results in the string '3'.

4. What is a keyword?
    - ? (Don't know)
    - Answer: Keywords are words that have special meanings within a language. Many editors will display them in special colors. These words cannot be used as variables.

5. What is the difference between a straight line program and a branching program?
    - Straight line program is the program with the straight flow. It doesn't have any diverging session nor going back session. It doesn't include any conditional or looping statement.
Otherwise, a branching program is the program that has a diverging flow of logic. It includes conditional statement, so its conclusion and logical path will be different depending on certain variable or input's value, or any other condition.
    - Answer: A straight line program simply goes through and carries out each step. A branching program will do different things depending on conditions set within the program.

6. What is a conditional?
    - conditional is a kind of statement which will operate differently depending on the condition.
Program with conditional statements are not run for the entire, but only the part where the condition meets will be run, while the other part will be ignored.
    - Answer: A conditional statement starts with an if statement, and can also include elif and else statements.
